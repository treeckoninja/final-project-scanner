# final-project-scanner
A bash script to scan for network vulnerabilities and generate reports.
# Network Vulnerability Scanner and Report Generator

## Overview

This project is a bash script designed to perform basic network vulnerability scanning and generate a formatted security report. It is capable of identifying open ports and will be expanded to include service and vulnerability detection.

## Purpose and Learning

This script is being developed as the final project for a course on Bash Scripting and Linux Command-Line Operations. The primary goals are to apply and demonstrate proficiency in:

* Shell scripting for automation
* Modular code design using functions
* Processing command-line arguments
* Integrating external tools like `nmap`
* Generating structured, readable reports

## Current Status

The script framework is complete. It currently accepts a target IP address or hostname and generates a structured, placeholder report. The core logic is built with functions for modularity and maintainability.

### How to Use

To generate a placeholder report, run the script with a target:

```bash
./report.sh <target_ip_or_hostname>
